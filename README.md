# Flashcard-Generator


use the app.js file to create flashcards.

to create a basic style flash card (showing front of card infor and then back of card info:
create a variable and set it ="new basic" ("information on the front of flashcard goes here","information on back of flashcard goes here");

call the card information by variablename.printStats();

or call specific information by console.log("variable".front); OR console.log("variable.back");


to create a flash card the shows partial text use the cloze cards.
to do so create a variable and set it equal to "new cloze"("information you do not want to show yet","information you want shown");

call the card information by variablename.printStats();

OR

call the information individually by console.log("vaiablename".cloze); or console.log("variablename".text); or 
console.log("variablename".fulltext);
